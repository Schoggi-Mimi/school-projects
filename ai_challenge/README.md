# Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Structure Prediction [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding)
- Team Name: HSLU StableConfusion

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the structure of RNA molecules, which holds significant importance in biological research, particularly in medical advancements and understanding life processes.

## Abstract

Here we present our approach and solution strategy for predicting RNA structures in the context of a competition. It covers various aspects including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics tailored for RNA data.

## Usage

The project is structured as follows:

- Data Quality Assessment
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Training
- Evaluation Metrics
- Results Analysis
