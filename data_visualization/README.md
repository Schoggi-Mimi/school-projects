# Air Quality in Relation to Performance

## DVIZ Project HS22

### Motivation

Air pollution is a major environmental concern that has made its way into indoor spaces, affecting people's productivity. This project aims to raise awareness about the potential consequences of indoor air pollution on productivity.

### Work Description

- **Data Collection**: Observed office spaces, collected data on equipment, including plants, air-Q devices, and workspaces.
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaned and transformed raw data from air-Q devices.
- **Visualization**: Used various chart types and color palettes to visualize data and communicate findings effectively.

### Used Chart Types

- Line charts for tracking behavior over time.
- Heatmaps for quick impressions.
- Comparison charts to compare magnitude of values.
- Distribution charts to see measurement values distributed along the time axis.
- Area charts to compare intensity of average measurements.

### Target Audience

This report is for everyone who works indoors, including office workers and students. Line charts are used for familiarity and understanding of behavior and progression over time.

### Data Source

Real-time data from an architecture office for GKS, extracted from air-Q sensors.

### Conclusion

Regularly opening windows and having more plants in an office can decrease CO2 and TVOC particles, leading to increased performance and health benefits. Constant monitoring of CO2 concentration is recommended to maintain worker performance.
