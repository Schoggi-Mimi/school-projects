# LIFE EXPECTANCY ANALYZER
- Team Name: DankDaten

## Background

In our course about Database Systems, we had to work in groups to create a database. This involved several steps, like planning what our project would do and how we can visualize the data. The focus was on creating a database that could be used to analyze data.

## Approach

We wanted to see if there was a connection between how much clean water a country has and how long people live there. To do this, we looked at data from the World Health Organization and other NGO's. We had to clean up the data, and then put it together to see if there was a link. Finally, we visualized our findings.

## Result

We found that countries with more clean water tend to have people who live longer. This makes sense because when a country has enough water, people can focus on other things that help them live longer, like for example good healthcare. Countries that don't have enough clean water have to focus on getting the basics, like food and water, so they can't spend as much time on improving life expectancy. Other things like wars or natural disasters can also make life expectancy go down temporarily because more people die.
